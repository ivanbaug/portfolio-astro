# portfolio-astro

Portfolio, this time using Astro for static site generation.

- The UI imitates the Julia Programming Languaje webpage https://julialang.org/ , took it as reference because it just looks clean and pretty sober.

- This time I used tailwind in place of bootstrap.

- Works well even if the browser doesn't support javascript or blocks it :)


## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
